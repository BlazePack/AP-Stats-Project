# ⚾ Home Run Predictor — AP Statistics Project

### 📊 Overview

This project was created for my **AP Statistics** course to explore whether a player’s **height** and **weight** can be used to predict their **home run totals**. Using real MLB player data, the model applies statistical analysis and regression techniques to identify trends and estimate home run output based on physical characteristics.

### 🧠 Project Goal

To determine if there’s a statistically significant relationship between a baseball player’s **height**, **weight**, and **home run production**, and to create a model that can predict home run counts from those variables.

### ⚙️ Features

* 📈 **Interactive Data Visualization** – Displays player height, weight, and home run totals in a 3D Chart.
* 🧮 **Linear Regression Model** – Predicts home run counts using height and weight as predictors.
* 🔍 **Statistical Insights** – Includes correlation coefficients, regression equations, and residual plots.
* 🌐 **Website Version** – The project is deployed online so viewers can interact with charts and explore predictions.

### 📂 Files Included

* `index.html` – The main website file displaying the charts and predictions.
* `style.css` – Custom styling for a clean and readable layout.
* `main.js` – Handles data visualization and regression calculations.
* `data.csv` – Contains MLB player data (height, weight, home runs).
* `dockerfile` – Configures Nginx on Ubuntu to host the site.

### 📉 Methodology

1. **Data Collection** – Gathered height, weight, and home run stats for MLB players.
2. **Exploratory Analysis** – Created scatterplots to visualize correlations.
3. **Regression Modeling** – Used least-squares regression to model the relationship.
4. **Model Evaluation** – Tested predictive accuracy and analyzed residuals for patterns.
